## Notes from John Castelloe, 2021-08-05

Here are my main motivations for the revisions in this wiki draft:
1. Address our two main audiences more clearly:
   * Nonprofits with Salesforce Administrator capability (whether a fully qualified Admin, accidental Admin, consultant, etc., doesn't matter which)
   * Active and potential contributors to the project
2. Fill in some gaps where our kind "beta testers" were getting lost trying to follow instructions
3. Make a clear distinction between *one-time* required setup tasks and other things like maintenance, optional customizations, and best practices
   * Get the reader as efficiently as possible through the necessary "grin and bear it" stuff to the point of logging into the mobile app as a field worker and seeing a Salesforce survey there
4. Minor typo/grammar corrections

### Major Changes

1. Changed occurrences of terms like "mobile app user" to "field worker" (per Trish's suggestion)
2. Split the `Configuration` page into two new sections, `Getting Your Field Workers Started` and `Further Customization`, each of which has some new content/pages
3. Added new content to the `Salesforce Initial Setup` page, with most of the content in the `Build Your First Field Survey` section coming from Trish

### Minor Changes

1. Added a new `Setting Up Salesforce Automation` page that I call a "minor change" for now because it's only a placeholder, but Trish has brilliant ideas for how to flesh this out!
   * I think this will be primarily about distributing information from submitted field surveys to other Salesforce objects
2. Added two small pages, `Localization` and `Mobile App Customization`, as new homes for some content from the old `Configuration` page
3. Replaced a couple screenshots where I noticed that user interfaces had changed (e.g., Auth0 renamed "Users & Roles" to "User Management")
