# Draft Wiki for Grassroots Mobile Survey App

(**TODO** Add screenshot with three panels: Login page | Filled-in example survey | Survey list with sync button )

The Grassroots Mobile Survey App is focused on providing affordable field survey capacity to nonprofits worldwide.

## How It Works

* Send your field workers out to the field -- the surveys you built are on their phones (whether they have internet out there or not!).
* On every visit with your clients, your field worker logs the data you need.
* Back on the internet -- hitting the sync button sends the data right to your Salesforce.

## How You Get There

* Install the Salesforce package with a few clicks. Four(?) more steps and Salesforce is ready to go.
* Set up the handshake between the mobile app and the Salesforce app -- our easy-to-follow instructions walk you through it -- no sweat.
* Help your field workers install the mobile app on their smart phones.
